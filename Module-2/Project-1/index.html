        <h2>websites are built with HTML</h2>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>HTML is a markup language that tells the browser what everything is.</p>
        <h2>Thye also use CSS</h2>
        <p>I can't wait to start learning CSS!</p>
        <p>Strong and emphasis elements help put important on our text</p>
        <h2>The strong tag</h2>
        <p>We use the strong tag to put strong importance on text</p>
        <h3>An example</h3>
        <p><strong>Warning:</strong> Watch out for the guard dog</p>
        <h2>The emphasis tag</h2>
        <p>We use the emphasis tag to put stress emphasis on our text</p>
        <h3>An example</h3>

        <h2>Linking between pages</h2>
        <p>Adding links is very easy to do! We use <a href="anchors.html">anchors</a> to link from one page to another, and we tell it what page to link to using  <a href="attributes.html">attributes</a>.</p>
